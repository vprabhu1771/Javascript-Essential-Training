trim(): Removes whitespace from both ends of a string.

Here's an example of how to use the `trim` method in JavaScript:

const str = "   Hello, World!   ";
const trimmedStr = str.trim();
console.log(trimmedStr);

Output
"Hello, World!"


In this example:

- We have a string `str` containing the text "   Hello, World!   " with leading and trailing whitespace.
- We use the `trim` method to remove the whitespace from both ends of the string.
- The method returns a new string with the whitespace removed.
- So, the output will be "Hello, World!".
