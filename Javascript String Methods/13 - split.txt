split(separator, limit): Splits a string into an array of substrings.

Here's an example of how to use the `split` method in JavaScript:

const str = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
const words = str.split(" ");
console.log(words); 

Output 
["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]


In this example:

- We have a string `str` containing the text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
- We use the `split` method with a space (" ") as the separator to split the string into an array of words.
- The method returns an array of substrings, split at each point where the separator occurs.
- So, the output will be an array of words: `["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]`.

Here's another example, splitting a string by commas:


const csv = "apple,banana,orange,grape";
const fruits = csv.split(",");
console.log(fruits); 

Output
["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]


In this example:

- We have a string `csv` containing the text "apple,banana,orange,grape".
- We use the `split` method with a comma (",") as the separator to split the string into an array of fruit names.
- The method returns an array of substrings, split at each point where the comma occurs.
- So, the output will be an array of fruits: `["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]`.

Additionally, you can limit the number of splits by providing a second argument:


const str = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
const limitedWords = str.split(" ", 4);
console.log(limitedWords); 

Output
["The", "quick", "brown", "fox"]


In this example:

- We use the `split` method with a space (" ") as the separator and limit the number of splits to 4.
- The method returns an array of the first 4 words: `["The", "quick", "brown", "fox"]`.
