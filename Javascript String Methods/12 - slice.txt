slice(start, end): Extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string.

Here's an example of how to use the `slice` method in JavaScript:


const str = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
const newStr = str.slice(10, 19);
console.log(newStr);

Output
"brown fox"


In this example:

- We have a string `str` containing the text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
- We use the `slice` method to extract a portion of the string, starting at index 10 and ending at index 19 (end index is not included).
- The method returns the substring from index 10 up to, but not including, index 19.
- So, the output will be "brown fox".

The `slice` method can also be used with negative indices to count from the end of the string:

const str = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
const newStr = str.slice(-8, -4);
console.log(newStr);

Output
"lazy"


In this example:

- We use the `slice` method with negative indices to extract the substring from 8 characters from the end to 4 characters from the end.
- So, the output will be "lazy".
