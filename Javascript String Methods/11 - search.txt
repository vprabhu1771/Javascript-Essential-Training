replace(searchValue, replaceValue): Searches a string for a specified value or a regular expression, and returns a new string where the specified values are replaced.

Here's an example of how to use the `search` method in JavaScript:


const str = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
const position = str.search(/fox/);
console.log(position); 

Output
16


In this example:

- We have a string `str` containing the text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
- We use the `search` method with a regular expression `/fox/` to find the position of the substring "fox" within the string.
- The method returns the index of the first match, which is 16 (0-based indexing).
- So, the output will be 16. If the substring "fox" were not found, `search` would return -1.
