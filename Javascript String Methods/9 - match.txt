match(regexp): Returns an array containing all matches of a regular expression within the string.

Here's an example of how to use the `match` method in JavaScript:

const str = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";

const matches = str.match(/o/g);

console.log(matches);

Output
["o", "o", "o"]


In this example:

- We have a string `str` containing the text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
- We use the `match` method with a regular expression `/o/g` to find all occurrences of the letter "o" in the string.
- The `g` flag is used to perform a global search, which means it finds all matches rather than just the first one.
- The method returns an array containing all matches found, in this case, `["o", "o", "o"]`.
- Each element in the array corresponds to a match found in the string.
