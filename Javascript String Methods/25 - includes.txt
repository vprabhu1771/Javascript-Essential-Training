includes(searchString, position): Checks whether one string contains another substring.

Here's an example of how to use the `includes` method in JavaScript:


const str = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
const result1 = str.includes("quick");
const result2 = str.includes("cat");

console.log(result1);

Output
true

console.log(result2);

Output
false


In this example:

- We have a string `str` containing the text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
- We use the `includes` method to check if the string contains the substring "quick".
- `result1` will be `true` because the string does indeed contain "quick".
- We also check if the string contains the substring "cat".
- `result2` will be `false` because "cat" is not present in the string.

Here's another example using the `position` parameter:


const str = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
const result = str.includes("quick", 10);
console.log(result);

Output
false


In this example:

- We use the `includes` method to check if the string contains the substring "quick", starting the search from position 10.
- The method returns `false` because "quick" does not appear after position 10 in the string.

Here's one more example with a different starting position:

const str = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
const result = str.includes("fox", 10);
console.log(result);

Output: true


In this example:

- We check if the string contains the substring "fox", starting the search from position 10.
- The method returns `true` because "fox" appears after position 10 in the string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
