the javascript array reduceRight method executes a reducer function on each element of the array and applies it againt an accumulator.

parameters:

callback -> function to execute on each element of the array. it takes in:

	accumulator - it accumulates the callbackâ€™s return values it is initialvalue for the first call if supplied.


currentValue -> the current element beign passed from the array.


initialValue -> (optional) a value that will be passed to callback on first call. if not provided the last element acts as the 
accumulator on the first call and callback went executes on it



note:

calling reduceRight on an empty array without initialValue will throw type error.


return:

returns the value resulting after reducing the array.


notes:

reduceRight -> executes the given function for each value from right to left.

reduceRight -> does not change the original array.

it is almost alway safer to provide initial value.
