NodeList objects are collections of nodes, usually returned by properties such as Node.childNodes and methods such as document.querySelectorAll().



Note: Although NodeList is not an Array, it is possible to iterate over it with forEach(). It can also be converted to a real Array using Array.from().

However, some older browsers have not implemented NodeList.forEach() nor Array.from(). This can be circumvented by using Array.prototype.forEach() â€” see this document's Example.


Live vs. Static NodeLists

Although they are both considered NodeLists, there are 2 varieties of NodeList: live and static.



Live NodeLists

In some cases, the NodeList is live, which means that changes in the DOM automatically update the collection.


Static NodeLists

In other cases, the NodeList is static, where any changes in the DOM does not affect the content of the collection. The ubiquitous document.querySelectorAll() method returns a static NodeList.

It's good to keep this distinction in mind when you choose how to iterate over the items in the NodeList, and whether you should cache the list's length.
