Declaring a variable

To use a variable, you’ve first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable. 

To do this, we type the keyword var or let followed by the name you want to call your variable:

var x = 10;

var y = 20;

var sum = x + y;

var name = “prabhu”

Here we’re creating some variables called x , y, sum and name. Try typing these lines into your web browser’s console. 

After that, try creating a variable (or two) with your own name choices.

var age = 20;

var year = 2021;

Note: In JavaScript, all code instructions should end with a semi-colon (;)

You can test whether these values now exist in the execution environment by typing just the variable’s name, e.g. 

Try typing these lines into your web browser’s console

> x

10

> y

20

> sum

30

> name

prabhu

> age

20

> year

2021
